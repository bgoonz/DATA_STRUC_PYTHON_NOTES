    <p>
      Here at App Academy, our browser of choice is Google Chrome. This isn’t
      super important at the beginning of the course, but once we get into
      frontend development (writing code that runs in a web browser) the Chrome
      DevTools will be crucial for debugging every manner of issue. Other
      browsers do include Devtools, but they may work slightly differently than
      the ones in Google Chrome.

      If you want to follow along with instructors and our curriculum you will
      want to make sure you install Google Chrome or it’s open source equivalent
      Chromium.

    <p>
      To install Google Chrome, download the necessary files and follow the
      instructions on the
      <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html"

      macOS users should just download the Google Chrome DMG (Disk image) file
      and double click on it to mount it as a drive. Then drag the Chrome icon
      to your Applications Folder, then you can eject the Google Chrome Disk
      Image by dragging it to the Trash.
