      Setting up your computer for AppAcademy
    </h1>
    <p>
      In order to be successful in the course itâ€™s good that your computer be
      setup in a very specific way so as to not waste your time fighting the
      setup of tools and applications, so you can concentrate on the new
      material you are learning.
    </p>
    <p>
      While you are learning how to setup Node.JS or Python, and that can be a
      useful skill, we are more concerned with learning to program in these
      languages than we are how to install the tools and languages on your
      computer.
    </p>
    <p>
      First head to the guide for your particular operating system. This will
      give you an overview of anything in particular you should be aware of for
      your system.
    </p>
    <p>
      From there you can proceed to the individual sections for installing
      Google Chrome, Visual Studio Code, Node.JS, Python, and Docker.
