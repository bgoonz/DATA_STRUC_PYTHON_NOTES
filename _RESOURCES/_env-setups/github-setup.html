    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Git is a free and open source distributed version control system
        designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with
        speed and efficiency.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      git is a software program much like <em>MS Word</em> or
      <em>Google Chrome</em> but it is part of a class of programs known as
      <strong>cli tools</strong>. This program does not have a UI like most
      programs we are familiar with but instead is accessible primarily through
      our <strong>command line</strong>/<strong>terminal</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being accessible primarily only through the
      <strong>command line</strong>/<strong>terminal</strong> sounds like a huge
      restriction but it allows us as developers to use it for what it’s good at
      and for it to then quickly go away. So what does git do? Well it is a
      <em>Version Control System</em> or <strong>VCS</strong>. It keeps track of
      a set of files over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each time changes are wanting to get recorded, they are wrapped in what we
      call a ‘commit’ and that commit is saved to the repo as a snapshot of the
      files at that time. The tracking and reconciling abilities that git has to
      handle conflicts makes git an effective tool for many developers to work
      on the same codebase at the same time as well as to record the history of
      a project in the case an issue is introduced.
    </p>
    <h3 id="what-is-github">What is GitHub?</h3>
    <p>
      Github is a company that provides hosting for git repos. It works together
      with the git cli tools to manage the codebase by making or deleting
      branches, creating pull requests, and sharing the git project with other
      developers.
    </p>

    <h2 id="installing-git">Installing git</h2>
    <h3 id="windows">Windows</h3>
    <p>
      If you have WSL already setup and are using an Ubuntu distribution, you
      already have git within linux! If you are using a different distribution
      you may need to manually install git.
    </p>
    <p>
      While we don’t need git installed in Windows, we do want to have the
      git-credential-manager-core installed. It comes bundled with git so we can
      easily install it in Windows by using the installer found
      <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win">here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you’ve downloaded one of the “Git for Windows Setup” distributions
      (either 32-bit or more likely 64-bit) you can launch the installer and
      accept all the defaults.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that git-credential-manager-core is installed, we can restart our
      terminal and continue on working through this guide.
    </p>
    <h3 id="mac">Mac</h3>
    <p>
      Mac comes with some tools by default. git is one that we want to make sure
      is up to date so we can run the following in our terminal.
    </p>
    <pre class="shell"><code>xcode-select --install</code></pre>
    <h2 id="configuring-git">Configuring git</h2>
    <p>
      Once you have installed git we want to configure the information that gets
      logged in each commit that we make. We want to update our default (global)
      credentials that git uses. You could overwrite these temporarily per local
      repo but for our purposes, that won’t be necessary, though it is helpful
      to know that is an option for us.
    </p>
    <p>In your terminal (on Mac or WSL), run</p>
    <pre
      class="shell"
    ><code>git config --global user.name &quot;Your Name&quot; 
git config --global user.email &quot;Your Email&quot;</code></pre>
    <h2 id="configuring-github">Configuring github</h2>
    <p>
      Like previously mentioned, Github provides us a mechanism to share code
      with other developers. Because of the nature of code, there needs to be a
      way to authenticate to make sure that someone is authorized to fetch or
      contribute new code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thankfully for us, git handles this authentication flow automatically but
      for Github, we can’t use our Github accounts password. Instead, we can use
      a Personal Access Token as a password to authenticate to Github and save
      it in a password manager of sorts so we don’t have to use the PAT every
      command that requires auth.
    </p>
    <h3 id="secrets-manager">Secrets Manager</h3>
    <p>
      Before we get a PAT from Github and use it for auth - we should setup our
      Secrets Manager.
    </p>
    <h4 id="windows-1">Windows</h4>
    <p>
      WSL doesn’t have a password manager by default in most distributions so we
      would need to install one if we don’t want our token saved in plain text
      or only temporarily in memory. Thankfully, we can actually tell git to use
      Windows Credential Manager. Just run the following command in WSL:
    </p>
    <pre
      class="shell"
    ><code>git config --global credential.helper &quot;/mnt/c/Program\ Files/Git/mingw64/libexec/git-core/git-credential-manager-core.exe&quot;</code></pre>
    <p>
      We now have WSL trying to use the git-credential-manager-core to
      facilitate our credentials management.
    </p>
    <h4 id="mac-1">Mac</h4>
    <p>
      MacOS has a built in password/secret manager called keychain. We can tell
      git to use keychain with the following line in our terminal:
    </p>
    <pre
      class="shell"
    ><code>git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain</code></pre>
    <h3 id="personal-access-token">Personal Access Token</h3>
    <p>
      Once our secret manager is setup, we want to
      <strong>restart our terminal/WSL Shell</strong>. Once restarted, we want
      to do two things. Generate a token from Github, and use that as our
      authentication for a privileged command.
    </p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <p>
          To get a new token, navigate to
          <a href="https://github.com/settings/tokens"
            >Personal access tokens</a
          >
          in Github settings. You can navigate there yourself by going to
          <code
            >settings &gt; Developer settings &gt; Personal Access Tokens</code
          >
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Once here, click <strong>Generate new token</strong>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Give your token a descriptive name. I name it for what device I will
          use the token from. This way, all of my computers have their own
          unique token and if I ever need to, I can revoke a token. We also want
          to use this menu to set when our token expires and give it the allowed
          permissions. For out purposes we want to at least have all the repo
          permissions.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        Once we have our token ready to generate, we want to try running a
        privileged command in git so we get a password prompt. Once we click
        <strong>Generate token</strong> at the bottom of the
        <em>new token form</em> we will only be able to see the token once.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <ol start="4" type="1">
      <li>
        Now that we have our token, we can use it when git prompts us for a
        password. If you are on Windows, you won’t receive a password prompt but
        instead you will receive a pop-up that asks for you Personal Access
        Token. Because we previously configured our password/secret manager, our
        input will be saved for us. This way, we don’t need to keep track of our
        PAT.
      </li>
    </ol>
