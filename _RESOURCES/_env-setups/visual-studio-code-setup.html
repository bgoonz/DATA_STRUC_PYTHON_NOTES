    <h1 id="visual-studio-code">Visual Studio Code</h1>
    <p>
      Our code editor of choice in this course is Microsoft’s Visual Studio
      Code.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is an open source cross-platform code editor built with
      Javascript.<br />
      Don’t confuse this with Microsoft’s other product
      <em>Visual Studio</em> which is designed to only program for the Windows
      platform. Visual Studio Code (or VSCode) is a multi-language editor that
      can handle almost any programming language for any platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      Go to website for
      <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>, then
      download and install VS Code.
    </p>
    <p>You’ll want to make sure you download the Stable release.</p>
    <h2 id="macos">macOS</h2>
    <p>
      Download the DMG (Disk Image) file for VSCode and open it up. This will
      mount as virtual ‘disk’ on your desktop. Drag the VSCode icon to your
      Applications folder and then eject the virtual disk on the Desktop by
      dragging it to the Trash.
    </p>
    <p>
      In macOS the command line utility <code>code</code> isn’t instaled by
      default when you install VSCode.
    </p>
    <p>
      Open the VS Code editor, open the Command Palette
      (<code>Cmd+Shift+P</code>) and type type <code>shell command</code> to
      find the
      <code>Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH</code> command.
    </p>
    <p>
      This will now allow you to easily open files in VS Code from the terminal
      using the <code>code</code> command followed by a file or directory.
    </p>
    <h2 id="windows">Windows</h2>
    <p>
      In Windows we will be using VSCode alongside WSL (Windows Subsystem for
      Linux)
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to do this, we must make sure we install this VSCode extension:
    </p>
    <p>
      <a
        href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl"
        >Remote: WSL by Microsoft</a
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you’ve installed this you can open VSCode and connect to your WSL
      instance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Make sure you read this tutorial from Microsoft on how to use WSL and
      VSCode together:
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/wsl-tutorial"
        >Remote Development in WSL</a
      >
    </p>
    <h2 id="ubuntu">Ubuntu</h2>
    <p>
      To install VSCode in Ubuntu Linux, download the 64-bit .deb file to your
      Downloads folder, the open that folder in your File Manager and double
      click on it to install it.
