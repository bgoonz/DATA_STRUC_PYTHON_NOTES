It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and
underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis. Too
often, we convince ourselves that massive success requires massive action.
Whether it is losing weight, building a business, writ-ing a book, winning a
championship, or achieving any other goal, we put pressure on ourselves to
make some earth- shattering improvement that everyone will talk
about.Meanwhile, improving by 1 percent isn’t particularly notable—
sometimes it isn’t even noticeable—but it can be far more meaningful,
especially in the long run. The difference a tiny improvement can make over
time is astounding. Here’s how the math works out: if you can get 1 percent
better each day for one year, you’ll end up thirty- seven times better by the
time you’re done. Conversely, if you get 1 percent worse each day for one
year, you’ll decline nearly down to zero. What starts as a small win or a minor
setback accumulates into something much more.
Habits are the compound interest of self- improvement. The same way that
money multiplies through compound interest, the effects of your habits
multiply as you repeat them. They seem to make little dif-ference on any given
day and yet the impact they deliver over the months and years can be
enormous. It is only when looking back two, five, or perhaps ten years later
that the value of good habits and the cost of bad ones becomes strikingly
apparent.This can be a difficult concept to appreciate in daily life. We often
dismiss small changes because they don’t seem to matter very much in the
moment. If you save a little money now, you’re still not a million-aire. If you go
to the gym three days in a row, you’re still out of shape. If you study Mandarin
for an hour tonight, you still haven’t learned the language. We make a few
changes, but the results never seem to come quickly and so we slide back into
our previous routines.Unfortunately, the slow pace of transformation also
makes it easy to let a bad habit slide. If you eat an unhealthy meal today, the
scale doesn’t move much. If you work late tonight and ignore your family, they
will forgive you. If you procrastinate and put your project off until tomorrow,
there will usually be time to finish it later. A single decision is easy to dismiss.
